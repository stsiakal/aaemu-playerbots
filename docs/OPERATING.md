# Operating the bots

Reference for running and tuning aaemu-playerbots: configuration, the goals, the GM bootstrap and
its safety rules, chat and the optional LLM, the web UI. The [README](../README.md) has the
overview and the quick start, [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md) describes the server issue reports, and
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) explains how the code is built.

* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Goals and behaviour](#goals-and-behaviour)

## Configuration

Everything is set in one TOML file. `playerbots example-config > playerbots.toml` writes the
commented example (`playerbots.example.toml` in the repository); every key is optional, the values
in the example are the defaults, and an unknown key is an error. `playerbots run --config <file>`
reads it (default `playerbots.toml`).

| Section | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `[server]` | The login server's public address (`login`), the world to enter (`world_id`), the bot account prefix and the shared password. |
| `[data]` | Paths of the server's `compact.sqlite3` and `app/Data` directory, the baked data directory (`baked`) and the world name. |
| `[bots]` | How many bots, the login ramp, the roster file, the races for new characters, `gm_bootstrap`, tick and speed settings (`move_update_ms`: the movement updates of a walker a real player can see, 125 ms), reconnect back-off. |
| `[behavior]` | The weights of the goals (0 switches a goal off), the personas' spread, the switches `trade_with_players`, `portals`, `dungeons`, `dungeon_level_up`, `sailing` and `navmesh`, and the life-like movement settings `lifelike`, `jump_rate` and `emotes`. |
| `[dungeons]` | Dungeon parties: the wait for a smaller party (`relax_after_secs`, 600 s; four bots rally 90 s for a fifth) and whether the server's entry limit is counted (`entry_limit`, off: the 1.2 server has none). |
| `[sail]` | The boat the sailing goal uses: `ship` = `rowboat` (default), `clipper`, `cutter`, `junk`, `yawl`, `schooner` or `auto` (see [Sailing](#sailing)). |
| `[market]` | Selling: `enabled`, `auction`, `chat_ads`, `sell_to_players`, `meet_at`, `max_ads_per_hour` and `ad_interval_secs` (see [Selling](#selling-market)). |
| `[guild]` | Guilds, off by default: `enabled`, `found`, `min_level`, `party_size`, `max_guilds`, `accept_player_invites` and `churn_per_hour` (see [Guilds](#guilds-guild)). |
| `[pvp]` | Player versus player, off by default: `enabled`, `defend`, `attack_bots`, `attack_players`, `gank`, `warzone`, `never_names`, `only_names`, `max_squad`, `retreat_hp_pct` and `war_kill_cap`. |
| `[events]` | World events such as rifts, off by default: `enabled`, `max_bots_per_event`, `max_share`, `join_delay_secs` and `avoid_war_zones` (see [World events](#world-events-events)). |
| `[party]` | Bots and the parties of real players, off by default: `join_player_parties`, `chat_commands` and `follow_into_dungeons`. |
| `[population]` | The web UI's population director, off by default and a dry run when on: `enabled`, `dry_run`, `max_spawn_per_min` and `min_action_gap_secs`. |
| `[farm]` | Farming, off by default: `enabled`, `max_plots`, `growth_rate`, `public_farms`, `own_land`, `replant`, `max_trip_m`, and the wild farms `wild`, `wild_plots`, `wild_outlaw`, `steal` and `steal_from_players`. |
| `[presence]` | Log-in schedules, off by default: `enabled`, `min_online`, `max_online`, `max_starts_per_min`, `max_stops_per_min`, `goodbye_chance` and `utc_offset_hours` (see [Presence](#presence-presence)). |
| `[explore]` | The explore goal, on by default: `enabled`, `max_trip_m`, `level_gap` and `trip_gap_mins` (see [Exploring](#exploring-explore)). |
| `[gear]` | Gear that follows progression, on by default: `enabled`, `buy`, `mint`, `socket`, `regrade` (off), `max_spend_pct`, `check_secs` and `max_trip_m` (see [Gear](#gear-gear)). |
| `[web]` | The web UI's `bind` address and optional `token`. |
| `[social]` | The chat limits (see [Chat and the LLM](#chat-and-the-llm)). |
| `[personality]` | Personalities, on by default: `enabled`, the profanity cap `profanity` (`off`, `mild` default, `strong`), `llm_chatter`, `ambient_per_min` and `channel_lines_per_hour` (see [Personalities](#personalities)). |
| `[llm]` | The optional chat and director add-on. |
| `[issues]` | The server issue reports (see [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md)). |

A few details:

* `[data] compact` / `server_data` point at the server's `compact.sqlite3` and `app/Data`.
  `[data] baked` is the `--out` directory of `bake` (terrain heights, navigation meshes, zones,
  housing areas, quest spheres, world map); without it the bots walk straight lines on flat ground
  and the map has no picture.
* The login server must create unknown accounts (`AutoAccount`). Bot accounts are `<prefix><n>`
  (`server.account_prefix`, default `pb`) with one shared password: `server.password`, else
  `$PLAYERBOTS_PASSWORD`, else a random one that the first run generates and saves to
  `roster.secrets.json` next to the roster (readable by the owner only, git-ignored; never shown
  by the web API, the logs or `Debug`). Keep it together with `roster.json`. A roster that predates
  the file keeps the old public default `playerbots` for its existing accounts, with a warning at
  start-up; change the password of those accounts (and set `server.password`) or start over.
* The web UI is on `http://127.0.0.1:8790/` (`[web] bind`, optional `token` for POST requests;
  while it is bound to a loopback address every request must also carry a loopback `Host`).
* `playerbots run --count 50 --duration-secs 600` overrides the bot count and stops after ten
  minutes.
* Bots are started `bots.ramp_ms` apart; more can be started and stopped from the web UI.

## Goals and behaviour

Each bot has an archetype (class build and skill rotation) and a temperament (how much it likes
quests, duels, trading, trade runs, staying home). A utility scorer weighs the goals below by the
configured weights, the temperament and the situation and draws the next one; goals that fail rest
for a minute. The bot defends itself whatever it is doing.

| Goal | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Quest** | Picks a quest (journal first, then story, then the nearest side quest), walks to the giver, accepts, does the objectives (talk, kill, gather, use an item or doodad, reach a sphere) and turns in. Failures back off and repeated ones quarantine the quest. |
| **Grind** | Kills level-appropriate monsters near the bot and loots them. |
| **Duel** | A coordinator pairs two idle bots; they meet at a flag, challenge, accept, fight with their PvP rotation and rest afterwards. |
| **Player trade** | The coordinator pairs two bots; they meet, open the trade window, put up goods and/or money, lock and confirm. A trade request from a real player is accepted when the bot is idle. A bot puts up only tradable items it does not hold back for a quest (see [Selling](#selling-market)). |
| **Housing** | Picks a design and a free spot in a housing area, quotes the tax, places the house, builds it and later "goes home" to rest there. |
| **Auction** | Walks to the nearest auctioneer, lists surplus goods, buys a bargain and goes home (see [Auction house](#auction-house)). Needs `[market] enabled` and `auction`. |
| **Trade run** | Crafts a trade pack at a specialty workbench, carries it to a specialty NPC that buys it, sells it and collects the payment mail. It starts only when healthy and skips routes through deadly areas or zones of the hostile alliance. While carrying, the run is the only goal: no events, quests, duels, dungeons, other fights or blocked portals. A bot that dies with the pack goes back to the death spot for the dropped doodad; a pack it cannot recover is logged as lost and counted. |
| **Dungeon** | Bots that like a fight ask the coordinator for a party of up to five (the dungeon's player limit, never more than five; same alliance, a level the dungeon accepts; with `dungeon_level_up` and GM rights a lower level is raised). The planner prefers a tank and a healer, and a tank leads: it pulls and holds aggro, the rest assist its target and the healer heals the lowest member from behind. A full party starts at once, four bots rally 90 s for a fifth, a smaller one waits `[dungeons] relax_after_secs` (600 s) before going with a smaller one. The leader invites, the party walks to the entrance doodad and waits there a bounded time for a member that died on the way, goes in one by one, clears the dungeon along a route of its hostile spawns (the leader picks targets, the members follow and assist, everybody rests when low; deaths inside resume at the arrival point and the bot walks back; two wipes end the run), uses the exit doodad and disbands. The server's refusals are typed and answered (a dungeon it turned away is left alone; the entry limit is counted only with `[dungeons] entry_limit`); what the server does that the data contradicts is filed as an issue. |
| **Sail** | Summons a boat from a scroll at a beach, sails it 1 to 3 km over the sea (twice as far in a 6 m/s hull; a crossing to another beach or a loop) with a heading controller that finds the wheel's direction itself, then leaves the boat, despawns it and swims ashore. A rowboat by default; `[sail] ship` picks a clipper, cutter, junk, yawl or schooner. Sea only (no lakes or rivers). Needs a boat scroll in the bag or `gm_bootstrap`. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#sailing-goal-sail). |
| **Guild** | A bot with no guild that can pay the charter asks the coordinator for a founding team (a duty, whatever it is doing); five bots of one faction found a guild together. What a bot does in its guild afterwards (answer invitations, recruit, promote, talk, leave) is a duty that runs whatever the goal is. Needs `[guild] enabled`; see [Guilds](#guilds-guild). |
| **Gank** | Off until `[pvp] enabled` and `gank`, and someone may be attacked (`attack_bots`, or `attack_players` without `gm_bootstrap`). Plans an ambush post on the route between a specialty workbench and the NPC that buys its pack (outside the victims' home zones, where the server protects them; conflict zones and wars score higher), waits there and attacks a carrier of the hostile alliance when the odds are fair. Bots that wait close together form a squad of up to `max_squad` through the coordinator, so a stronger carrier can be taken. When the carrier dies the dropped pack is picked up (within 3 m, skill 11361) and a trade run sells it. It gives up on stronger groups, at the retreat line, on a protected target and after a death. See [Player versus player](#player-versus-player-pvp). |
| **Warzone** | Off until `[pvp] enabled` and `warzone`. Scored while a reachable land zone group is at war (conflict or war) with enough time left and the bot has not yet killed `war_kill_cap` characters in it: goes there, patrols from spot to spot, fights allowed characters when the odds are fair, regroups when hurt and leaves at peace. See [Player versus player](#player-versus-player-pvp). |
| **Event** | Joins a rift (a tower defence event) while one runs, walks to the defended target, kills the monsters of the current wave next to other bots and leaves when it ends. Needs `[events] enabled`; see [World events](#world-events-events). |
| **Companion** | A bot in the party of a real player follows the leader, helps in its fights, obeys a closed set of chat commands and, with `follow_into_dungeons`, goes through a dungeon door behind the leader. Needs `[party] join_player_parties`; see [Parties of real players](#parties-of-real-players-party). |
| **Farm** | Off until `[farm] enabled`. Plants, waits and harvests crops, and grows what the server is short of; outlaws may keep a small wild farm and take other bots' crops; see [Farming](#farming-farm). |
| **Explore** | Goes to see a zone the bot has never been to, a hill, the coast or a recall point within reach and safe for its level, and looks around there; see [Exploring](#exploring-explore). |
| **Gear** | Tiers up as the bot levels: buys a better piece from a merchant, mints the piece of its tier (`gm_bootstrap`), sockets a lunagem, regrades (opt-in). Putting on the better piece of the bag is a duty that runs whatever the bot does. See [Gear](#gear-gear). |
| **Rest / Wander** | Stand still until hit points and mana recover; stroll around. |
| **Social chat** | Answers whispers and nearby players (canned lines, or an LLM in character) and chats a little with other bots (see [Chat and the LLM](#chat-and-the-llm)). A background duty, not a goal. |
| **LLM director** (optional) | Now and then, and sooner after a level-up, a death, a failure or a new zone, asks the LLM for a short plan among the currently eligible goals and concrete variants of them (explore a zone, wander to a town, farm wild); keeps the notes it makes (see [Chat and the LLM](#chat-and-the-llm)). |

Bots survive death (they request the resurrection), disconnects (reconnect with backoff), name
rejections (a new name is picked) and restarts (the roster remembers accounts and characters).
Names, races, classes and temperaments are stored in `roster.json`: keep it.

Housing and trade runs need materials, labor, tax certificates and gold that a fresh character does
not have; see [GM bootstrap](#gm-bootstrap). Without it those goals only work when the bag already holds what
they need, and the LLM director never offers them.

## GM bootstrap

With `bots.gm_bootstrap = true` the bots may use GM chat commands (`/item add self ...`,
`/labor ...`, `/gold add self ...`, `/build ...`, and `/move` for long trips when
`bots.long_travel_teleport_m` is set) to get exactly what a trade run, a trade or a house needs.
The commands only work for accounts with access level 100. Print the SQL that grants it, run it on
the game database and restart the bots:

```sh
playerbots grant-gm-sql --config playerbots.toml     # UPDATE aaemu_game.accounts SET access_level = 100 WHERE username IN ('pb1', ...)
```

The statements name exactly the accounts of the roster (`--game-db` / `--login-db` name the
databases when the server does not use `aaemu_game` / `aaemu_login`); nothing like a name pattern
that a real player's account could match.

Because these accounts are GM accounts, `gm_bootstrap = true` is refused while the bots use the
public default password or none: give them a private one (the generated password does).

Safety of the GM lines:

* Only the bots' own goals send GM commands, and only with `gm_bootstrap` on; chat lines written by
  players or by the LLM can never become commands (see [Chat and the LLM](#chat-and-the-llm), "Safety"). Every plain chat line goes
  through one guard that refuses a command, however it is hidden (leading blanks, NULs, invisible
  or look-alike slashes); the GM path is a separate builder.
* All GM lines go through `Ctx::gm`, which allows only a short list of commands and always
  addresses the bot itself: `/level <own name> N`, `/labor <own name> N`, `/move <own name> x y z`,
  `/item add self ...`, `/gold add self ...`. The server aims some commands at the sender's
  target (or at the sender when it has none), so the target is cleared (`CSChangeTarget(0)`) in the
  same flush before each of them, and after a fight against a character. `/build` is the one
  command that needs a target (the house), and it is sent right after targeting that house.
* `[behavior] trade_with_players = false` (default): a bot trades only with other bots of the
  roster and declines the trade request of any other character, so nobody can farm the goods and
  gold the bots mint for themselves. The option is ignored while `gm_bootstrap` is on.
* `[behavior] portals = true` (default): bots may travel by portal (teleport book, recall points,
  gates); `false` keeps them off portals.
* `[behavior] dungeons = true` (default): bots may form parties and enter instance dungeons (goal
  `dungeon`); `false` keeps them out of both.
* `[behavior] dungeon_level_up = false` (default): with `bots.gm_bootstrap`, `true` lets a bot below a
  dungeon's level range raise its level to the range's minimum with the GM `/level` command
  (logged); `false` keeps dungeons to the bots whose level fits.
* `[dungeons] relax_after_secs = 600` (default): how long a wish waits for a smaller party
  (the dungeon's `max_players`, at most five) before it starts; four bots start after 90 s of
  rallying for a fifth. At most 600: the coordinator drops a party wish after 720 s and the bot
  gathers for at most 660 s, so a longer wait would never form the smaller party.
* `[dungeons] entry_limit = false` (default): the bots do not count the server's entry limit (three
  entries per zone group and four hours) and never skip a dungeon for the count, as on the 1.2
  server (`Dungeons.EntryLimit` is off there). A refusal for the limit is still answered. `true`
  counts the entries like the server does and skips a dungeon whose entries are used up.
* `[behavior] sailing = true` (default): bots may summon boats and sail (goal `sail`); `false` keeps
  them on land. `[sail] ship` chooses the boat, see [Sailing](#sailing).
* `[behavior] lifelike = true` (default): bots move like people (jumps, emotes, idle mannerisms);
  `false` keeps them walking and standing still. `jump_rate = 1.0` scales how often they jump (0 =
  never) and `emotes = true` lets them use emotes. It only shows when a real player (a character that
  is not one of this process's bots) is within 150 m, and never while a bot fights, trades, sails or is
  in an instance. The server logs every emote at WARN (`express_text - ExpressEmotion`); a
  process-wide allowance keeps that to a few lines a minute however many bots run. To see what the
  bots do: `RUST_LOG=info,pb_life=debug` logs every jump and emote, and `pb_move=trace` logs the
  movement packets other characters send, as the server relays them. Details in
  [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#life-like-movement-botmannerrs).
* `[market] sell_to_players = false` (default): bots sell only to other bots and the auction house;
  `true` lets them also sell to real players, and is ignored while `gm_bootstrap` is on (same rule
  as `trade_with_players`).
* `[behavior] navmesh = true` (default): bots walk routes on the navigation mesh baked from the
  client (`nav_main_world.bin`, one more per instance world) instead of straight lines: around
  walls, cliffs and water, along roads, with rounded corners and a slower pace over the last metres.
  Short trips are planned on the bot's own task, long ones by two planner threads; a goal the mesh
  cannot reach, or a planner that answers late, falls back to the straight line. `false` keeps the
  straight lines. Without the baked mesh the option does nothing. Counters (searches inline and
  pooled, latency, fallbacks, stuck events, trips) are in `/api/stats` under `nav` and in the log
  once a minute.

## Switched-off features

These sections are all off by default; `enabled = false` (or the `false` default of the switch named
below) keeps the bots exactly as they were without them. Every goal they belong to is built (see
[Goals and behaviour](#goals-and-behaviour)): the pvp goals are described in [Player versus
player](#player-versus-player-pvp), the event goal in [World events](#world-events-events), the
companion goal in [Parties of real players](#parties-of-real-players-party) and the farm goal in
[Farming](#farming-farm).

| | `gank` | `false` | Bots ambush trade-pack carriers (goal `gank`). |
| | `warzone` | `false` | Bots fight in zones at war (goal `warzone`). |

| | `war_kill_cap` | `10` | Most characters one bot kills in one war of a zone group before it leaves the war (1 to 100). |
| `[events]` | `enabled` | `false` | Master switch of the event features (goal `event`; see [World events](#world-events-events)). |
| | `max_bots_per_event` | `6` | At most this many bots join one event. |
| | `max_share` | `0.25` | At most this share (0 to 1) of the online bots that are high enough for the event takes part in events at once. |
| | `join_delay_secs` | `[10, 120]` | A bot waits a random number of seconds in `[low, high]` before it joins. |
| | `avoid_war_zones` | `true` | With `enabled`: the quest, grind and wander goals choose no destination in a zone group at war, and bots do not join an event there. |
| `[party]` | `join_player_parties` | `false` | Bots join the parties of real players when invited (goal `companion`; see [Parties of real players](#parties-of-real-players-party)). |
| | `chat_commands` | `false` | Bots obey the chat commands of their party (`follow`, `stay`, `come`, `assist`, `leave`, `dungeon <name>`) and invite a player who whispers `inv`. |
| | `follow_into_dungeons` | `false` | A bot in a player's party follows it through the doors of instance dungeons. |
| | `max_level_gap` | `10` | A bot declines a player more than this many levels away (and leaves when the gap grows to this plus five). |
| | `max_companions` | `8` | This process has at most this many bots in the parties of real players. |
| | `max_per_player` | `4` | At most this many of them in one player's party (1 to 4). |
| `[population]` | `enabled` | `false` | Master switch of the population director (see [World metrics and the population director](#world-metrics-and-the-population-director), which lists every key). |
| `[farm]` | `enabled` | `false` | Master switch of the farming features (goal `farm`). |
| | `max_plots` | `5` | One bot tends at most this many plots (the server allows 10 on a public field farm, 5 on the other kinds). |
| | `growth_rate` | `1.0` | The game server's `World.GrowthRate` (not on the wire): ripe times are planned with it. |

| | `own_land` | `true` | Plant on the land of the bot's own houses. |
| | `replant` | `true` | Plant the seeds a harvest gives back on the spot the crop stood. |
| | `max_trip_m` | `4000.0` | The farthest a bot walks to a farm, a vendor or a plot (metres). |
| | `wild` | `false` | Outlaw bots also keep a small farm out in the wild (no protection, costs labor; see [Farming](#farming-farm)). |
| | `wild_plots` | `3` | One bot keeps at most this many wild plots, part of `max_plots` (0 to 32). |

| | `steal` | `false` | Outlaw bots harvest ripe wild crops of the other bots of this process. |
| | `steal_from_players` | `false` | With `steal`: the wild crops of real players too; never while `bots.gm_bootstrap` is on. |
| `[presence]` | `enabled` | `false` | Bots log in and out on schedules of their own (see [Presence](#presence-presence)). |
| | `min_online` | `0` | At least this many bots online at all hours. |
| | `max_online` | `0` | At most this many bots online (0: as many as the roster has). |
| | `max_starts_per_min` | `20` | Log-ins per minute at most (1 to 1000). |
| | `max_stops_per_min` | `3` | Log-outs per minute at most (1 to 1000). |
| | `goodbye_chance` | `0.1` | The chance (0 to 1) that a bot says goodbye before it logs out; needs `[social]`. |
| | `utc_offset_hours` | (machine) | The local time of the schedules as hours from UTC (-14 to 14); not set: the machine's local time. |

The process warns at start when `pvp.attack_players` is set together with `bots.gm_bootstrap`.

### Player versus player (`[pvp]`)

Everything is off until `[pvp] enabled`. One set of rules (`bot/pvp/rules.rs`) decides who a bot
may attack, for the defence, the `gank` goal and the `warzone` goal alike:

- Only a character of the hostile alliance (Nuian against Haranyan). A friendly or neutral
  character is never a target, and the bots never use the force attack to change that.
- Never a character in the home zone of its alliance: the server accepts the casts there and drops
  the damage without a word. A bot does not start such a fight (the zone owner comes from the
  baked zone grid, which is coarse at zone borders), and when casts are accepted for five seconds
  and nothing is hurt it gives the fight up, leaves that character alone for three minutes and
  logs `protected`.
- Never a name in `never_names` (game masters, friends), also not in self-defence. `only_names`
  narrows the real players that may be attacked.
- Our own bots only with `attack_bots`; real players only with `attack_players`, and never while
  `bots.gm_bootstrap` is on (what a GM-bootstrapped bot holds may be minted). A gank target must
  carry a trade pack.
- Never from inside a town's peace aura.

**Self-defence** (`defend`): a hostile character that hits the bot is fought back, whatever
`attack_bots` and `attack_players` say. Below `retreat_hp_pct` the bot breaks off, shuns the
attacker and runs to the recall point of its alliance's home zone (or straight away); a fight
that lasts longer than four minutes or a target more than 70 m away is dropped.

**Gank.** The post comes from the trade routes (`bot/pvp/post.rs`), the squads from the coordinator
(`bot/pvp/squad.rs`; a bot that waits offers itself every 25 s, bots of one alliance within 500 m
and 12 levels of each other are ordered together through the party plumbing). The odds
(`bot/pvp/fight.rs`: level and hit points of the bot and its friends within 40 m against the
target and its allies within 30 m) say attack (a ratio up to 1.25), wait for a squad (up to 3) or
leave it alone. Only the log tells what happened: `gank: ...` lines in the bot's event log.

**Warzone.** The conflict state of every zone group comes from the server; sea groups are skipped
(the bots are on foot). Kills are counted per `(zone group, end of the state)`; at `war_kill_cap`
the bot leaves that war. The server awards honor for a kill in a conflict zone, which the bot logs
at the end of the goal (`pvp: honor ...`).

## Guilds (`[guild]`)

Off by default (`enabled = false`). With it on, bots found guilds (the server calls them
expeditions), recruit each other, keep them running and, if you let them, take in real players.

```toml
[guild]
enabled = true
found = true                  # bots may found guilds (false: they only join)
min_level = 5                 # a bot founds or joins a guild from this level on
party_size = 5                # bots that sign a charter together
max_guilds = 3                # this process founds at most this many guilds
accept_player_invites = false # bots accept the invitations of real players
churn_per_hour = 0.2          # how often a member leaves a bot guild (0 = never)
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch of the guild features (the goal `guild` and the guild duty). |
| `found` | `true` | Bots may found guilds. Off: they only join existing ones. |
| `min_level` | `5` | A bot founds or joins a guild from this level on. The server needs level 5 for a charter, so a lower value only lets bots join. |
| `party_size` | `5` | Bots that found a guild together. The server needs a team of `Expedition.Create.PartyMemberCount` (five by default); more than five is five. |
| `max_guilds` | `3` | This process runs at most this many guilds, counting the founding teams that are under way (0 = none). |
| `accept_player_invites` | `false` | A bot that is in no guild accepts the invitation of a real player. Off: it declines. |
| `churn_per_hour` | `0.2` | How many times an hour a bot that has been in a bot guild for a quarter of an hour leaves it, on average (0 to 60). |

**Founding.** A bot with no guild, level 5 or more, 10000 copper (or `gm_bootstrap`, which mints the
gold) and no other business posts a wish with the coordinator (the guild duty does that, whatever the
bot is doing). When `party_size` such bots of one faction wish, the coordinator orders them to a founding
team: the highest level founds. The founder invites the others into a team by name (the server
checks no distance), creates the guild with a generated name (letters and spaces; a taken name is
replaced, up to five tries), and dismisses the team. A failure rests the bot for a minute to half an
hour, depending on the cause, and a refusal that the bots' own checks should have excluded (a team
member that is guilded or of another faction, a level too low) is filed as a server issue. The bots
wait about a minute and a half after the first one logs in before they found anything, so the bots
that are still logging in can report the guilds they are in, and `max_guilds` counts those.

**Life in a guild.** Whatever goal a bot runs, it answers guild invitations (a bot of a bot guild
says yes, a bot that is in a guild or a founding team says no, a real player's is answered by
`accept_player_invites`), and a member of a guild that bots own does the following:

* An officer (or the owner) invites an unguilded bot of its own faction every half minute or so,
  until the guild has twenty members. A bot that was invited is not invited by a second officer.
* The owner makes the best one or two bots officers once they have been in the guild half a
  minute (one officer from four members, two from eight).
* The owner and now and then an officer welcome a newcomer in guild chat; a newcomer says thanks;
  now and then a line of small talk. Guild chat is limited per guild and for all guilds together,
  and follows the `[social]` switches (`enabled`, `bot_chatter`, `chatter_needs_player`).
* A member leaves with the chance `churn_per_hour` gives. An owner never leaves a guild
  leaderless: it hands the guild to another bot of the guild first (an officer, else the highest
  level) and stays if there is none. A bot that left rests a minute and a half before it takes
  another invitation.

**Real players.** Bots never expel, promote or demote a real player, and they recruit only bots.
A real player who sends a bot officer the whisper "ginv", "guild invite" or "can i join" gets an
invitation (and a whisper that says so); a member that cannot invite names an officer who can. A
real player's line in guild chat is answered by one bot with a canned line. With
`accept_player_invites` a bot that is in no guild accepts a real player's invitation too.

**See it.** The web UI's bot list carries each bot's guild with its members (`guild` in
`/api/bots`); the bot's log has the `guild:` lines (invited, joined, handed over, left). Server
behaviour that contradicts the protocol (an accepted invitation that never became a membership, a
creation or leave the server ignored) is filed as an issue with keys `guild ...`.

## World events (`[events]`)

The server runs *rifts*: tower defence events (definitions in its `tower_defs` table, for example
the Crimson Rift) in which controller NPCs summon waves of monsters that march on a defended
target. A wave ends when the monsters it waits for are dead (everybody's kills count) or its timer
runs out, and the next one begins; the event ends after its last wave or at its time cap. With
`[events] enabled = true` the bots help.

* **What a bot does.** While an event runs, a bot that is between small things (idle, wandering,
  resting, grinding, questing; never in a duel, trade, trade run, dungeon or on a boat, and never
  when you forced a goal) and is high enough for the event's monsters, healthy (70 % hit points
  or more), not in an instance and not too far away, takes a slot, waits its join delay and
  goes. A long trip may use the portals (and the GM `/move` when `bots.long_travel_teleport_m` is
  set). At the defended target it stays within 40 m of it, picks the nearest monster that is a kill
  target of the *current* wave and that no other bot has claimed, and fights it with its normal
  rotation. It never attacks the event's controllers (the summoners and the rift itself). It
  leaves when the event ends or is ended by the server, when its hit points fall below 40 %
  (it stays away from that event for 5 minutes), after dying three times in the event, or when
  nothing has come to fight for 8 minutes (10 minutes away).
* **The crowd is limited.** `max_bots_per_event` bots at most take part in one event, and at most
  `max_share` of the online bots that are high enough for it take part in events at all (with 20
  such bots, `max_bots_per_event = 6` and `max_share = 0.3` it is 6). A bot waits a random time in
  `join_delay_secs` (the same every time for the same bot and event) before it asks, so a hundred
  bots do not arrive on the same second.
* **War zones.** `avoid_war_zones` (on by default) makes the quest, grind and wander goals choose no
  destination in a zone group the server reports at war, and keeps bots from joining an event there.
  It does not move a bot that already stands in such a zone group, and the `warzone` and `gank`
  goals ignore it. It only acts with `[events] enabled`.
* **The server.** The server starts its events by schedule (`tower_def_spawners`) or by the GM command
  `/towerdef start <def id>`; it announces them to everybody in the world, so every bot hears of
  them whatever it does. What else was seen of the server's events is in
  [What the server does with events](#what-the-server-does-with-events-as-of-the-last-live-run).
* **Server issues.** The bots report an event whose wave never showed any monster, a wave that
  did not advance after its kills and an event that outlived its cap (see [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md)).

The web UI shows the bots in the goal as `event` with a line such as `event: holding the Crimson Rift
(wave 2), 4 kills`, and the bots' event logs have `event: joining ...`, `event: at the ...` and
`event: leaving ... (why)` lines.

### What the server does with events (as of the last live run)

Seen while building the feature against the Rust server; the bots cope with all of it.

* Events start by schedule (`tower_def_spawners`, the times come from the spawn data) or with the
  GM command `/towerdef start <id>` **in the zone group of the GM**; most definitions are
  *unavailable* there ("Missing NPC spawner ... positions in zone group 20"; `/towerdef list` shows why),
  so in the Cinderstone zone group only the Crimson Rift (3) and the Grimghast Rift (13) can run.
* The server tells a bot about a running event when it enters the world (a list), so bots started in
  the middle of an event find it ("found in progress"); `SCTowerDefList` gives the position of the
  target unit **as it stood when the list was sent**, and the Crimson Rift's target units walk a
  path. The bots follow the live unit once they see it.
* A rift sits in a zone group that is at war (conflict state 6) part of the time. With
  `avoid_war_zones` on (the default) bots do not join then.
* The rifts' monsters are strong (levels 40 to 50, many at once): a bot whose levels came from
  `/level` and that has not learned its skills (the server refuses them with `SkillReqFail`) is not
  a fighter, so most bots in the live run left hurt and died. Real kills need real characters.
* An event nobody fights stays in its wave until its time cap (3600 s for the two rifts), when the
  server ends it; that is how a rift without players behaves, not a fault.

## Parties of real players (`[party]`)

Off by default. With it on, a bot that is invited by a real player (a character that is not one of the
bots of this process) joins the party, follows the leader, helps in the fights and, if you let it, goes
through a dungeon door behind the leader. Bot-only parties (dungeon runs, guild foundings, gank
squads) work as before; the party feature never touches the invitations of the bots of this process.

```toml
[party]
join_player_parties = true   # accept the invitations of real players (goal "companion")
chat_commands = true         # obey the chat commands of the party, answer "inv"
follow_into_dungeons = true  # follow the leader through dungeon doors
max_level_gap = 10           # decline a player more than this many levels away
max_companions = 8           # at most this many bots of this process in parties of real players
max_per_player = 4           # ... and at most this many in one player's party
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `join_player_parties` | `false` | A bot accepts the invitation of a real player when it is idle enough. Off: the invitation is declined like any other stray one. |
| `chat_commands` | `false` | The commands below, from the members of the bot's party, and a whisper "inv" from anyone (the invitation it sends also needs `join_player_parties`). |
| `follow_into_dungeons` | `false` | A bot in a player's party follows the leader through the doors of instance dungeons. |
| `max_level_gap` | `10` | An invitation from a player whose level (when the bot can see it) is more than this far from the bot's own is declined; a bot also leaves when the leader is more than this plus five levels away. At least 1. |
| `max_companions` | `8` | This process has at most this many bots in the parties of real players; more are declined. At most the number of bots. |
| `max_per_player` | `4` | At most this many of them in one player's party (1 to 4; a party holds five). |

**Invitations.** The server never expires a team invitation, and a pending one blocks every later
invitation to the same character, so a bot answers each invitation within seconds. It says **no at
once** when it is in a team already (a second membership would corrupt the server's team), in a
dungeon or loading, dead, trading, dueling, on a portal journey, a boat or a seat, or busy with a
goal it does not drop (a dungeon run, a duel or trade, a meeting with a buyer, the auction house, a
guild founding, a gank squad, a war, a rift, a trade run's trip or a boat trip); when the level gap
is too wide; or when a cap is reached. Otherwise it says **yes after a human pause** (1.5 to 3.5
seconds) and the companion goal replaces whatever small thing it did (quests, grinding, resting,
wandering, housing). A declined player gets one short whisper that says why (at most every two
minutes). The caps are kept by the hub (one short mutex); a place on the board that is not renewed
for 45 seconds, because the bot lost its connection, is given back.

**Following.** The leader is the owner of the team when that is a real player, else the first real
player online (a bot that invited a player owns the team until the player has joined; it hands the
lead over, four tries eight seconds apart). The bot walks to the leader's unit in view, else to the
position the server sends with every move of a team member (`SCTeamRemoteMembersEx`), and stops two
and a half to six metres short, a different distance for each bot of the party, so they do not stack.
It starts walking when the leader is more than eight metres away; beyond 120 m the way is a trip
(portals, GM `/move` when `long_travel_teleport_m` is set). While catching up (leader more than 20 m
away) the combat controller only turns on monsters that attack it. Below 40 % hit points a bot rests
next to the leader until 70 %.

**Fights.** The combat controller already helps any team member: the monsters that attack a member
first, then the member's target, within 45 m. `assist` points the bot at the leader's target for 20
seconds. The goal does not own the controller: a fight pauses it, and the bot follows again when the
fight is over. A bot told to `stay` only helps members within 12 m.

**Chat commands** (`chat_commands`). A closed set, no GM path, read from whispers, local chat and
party chat of the members of the bot's party (never from the bots of this process):

| Say | The bot |
| --- | --- |
| `follow` | follows the leader again (ends `stay`, `come` and `dungeon`) |
| `stay` | stands where it is |
| `come` | walks to the speaker |
| `assist` | attacks the speaker's target for 20 seconds |
| `leave` | leaves the party (the leader only) |
| `dungeon <name>` | walks to the entrance of the dungeon and waits there; the leader only; the name is matched by the beginning of its words ("which one?" when it names several) |
| `inv`, `invite me` (whisper, from anyone) | invites the speaker to its party, if the policy above allows it and the bot owns its party or has none |

Filler words are ignored ("follow me", "come here pls"); a line of more than six words is
conversation, not a command. The bot answers by whisper with a short natural line (a late joiner of a
team gets no party chat from the server, so nothing is said there).

**Roles.** A bot announces its party role on joining (`CSSetTeamMemberRole`): tank for tanks, healer
for healers, attacker for the rest. In a dungeon party the role also decides who leads (a tank
pulls), how close a member follows (a healer stays farther back) and whom a heal goes to: the
lowest living party member in reach, with the target switched to it for the cast and back to the
enemy after.

**Web.** The snapshot of a bot in a party (`GET /api/bots/{id}`, `GET /api/bots`) carries
`party`: `{id, leader, mode, members: [{name, role, level, leader, online, bot}]}` (`bot` is true for the
bots of this process; the field is absent when the bot is in no party). The goal shows as
`companion` with what it does (`following`, `staying`, `resting`, `going to the dungeon door`, `in the
dungeon`, ...).

**Dungeons** (`follow_into_dungeons`). The bot reads the leader's world from the position records of
the team: when the instance id is not 0 the leader is inside a dungeon (the record carries the
instance's zone key, which names the dungeon); a leader that was in view next to an entrance and
vanished counts as inside until a record says more. After a moment the bot walks to the entrance,
casts the entrance skill (the server puts a team member into the instance the team opened; a level
refusal is answered with `/level` when the bot may, `dungeon_level_up` and GM rights), follows and
assists inside, and walks to the exit and casts it when the leader is out again. A dungeon it cannot
enter (level, the entry limit when `[dungeons] entry_limit` is on, refusals) is left alone and the
leader is told once. The same happens when four entrance casts in a row load nothing (seen once,
after a death and a respawn: the server took the cast and did nothing); the bot stands by and
follows again when the leader is back. A bot that leaves the party inside is moved out by the
server after 15 seconds.

**Leaving.** A bot leaves when the leader tells it to, when no real player is left in the team, when
the real players have been offline for three minutes, or when the levels drifted more than
`max_level_gap` plus five apart.

**Limits.** A bot that dies loses the goal and starts it again after the respawn (it walks to the
entrance again; the entry limit applies). Mounts, boats and carts of the leader are not followed.
The bots of other `playerbots` processes on the same server count as real players, so two
processes with `[party]` on and the same server invite each other into the symmetric hand-over of
the lead; run the feature in one process, or keep the other's bots away from each other's invites.

## Sailing

The `sail` goal summons a boat at a beach, sails 1 to 3 km over the sea (twice as far in a 6 m/s hull)
and swims ashore after leaving the boat. `[behavior] sailing = false` switches it off. Which boat the
bots use is `[sail] ship`:

```toml
[sail]
ship = "cutter"    # rowboat (default) | clipper | cutter | junk | yawl | schooner | auto
```

* `rowboat` is the default and behaves as before. A scroll in the bag is used; without one a bot
  needs `bots.gm_bootstrap` (it adds the scroll with `/item add self`).
* `clipper` (6.5 m/s), `cutter` and `junk` (6.3 m/s), `yawl` (9.8 m/s) and `schooner` (6.5 m/s, the
  merchant ship) sail with the driver only: no crew, cannons or cargo yet. `auto` uses the
  family of a scroll the bag holds, else gives each bot a boat of its own (mostly rowboats and
  clippers, some cutters and junks, merchants like the schooner).
* A big hull needs room. The bot looks for a beach (within 1500 m of where it stands) where the
  server will accept the summon, sails a route that keeps 3 to 6 cells (48 to 96 m) off the coast and
  rounds its corners with the hull's own turn radius (a cutter turns on a circle of 280 m, a yawl 430
  m), and parks the hull out at sea (up to 260 m from the beach) before it swims in. A bot that
  stands on a shore with no such beach or sea within reach fails the goal and the brain tries
  something else after a minute (the log line is `sail: no launch beach with room for the boat near` or
  `sail: no trip from here`).
* The server sometimes refuses a summon for lack of room even where the height grid shows
  water (about one in ten of the live summons: rocks and piers are in its collision data, not
  the grid). The bot logs `sail: no room for the boat here; trying another beach` and tries two more
  beaches. If refusals are common on your server, raise `LAUNCH_DEPTH_MEDIUM_M` / `LAUNCH_DEPTH_LARGE_M`
  in `crates/playerbots/src/bot/goals/sail/trip.rs` (the water the hull's footprint needs at a
  launch).
* The speed is the server's: `ship_models.velocity * MoveSpeedMul^2 / 8`, plus up to 15 percent for a
  sailing ship that heads north or south (the official wind model). A trip is given up after 40
  minutes, or after 8 minutes and 2.5 times the time the route takes at top speed if longer.
* A boat that runs aground (the server never says so) is noticed by its speed: the bot backs off
  and plans again; a fourth grounding ends the trip.
* Issue reports of the goal are `sail:*` (no boat, no seat, dead wheel, no thrust, slow boat, ignored
  despawn); see [ISSUES.md](ISSUES.md).

## Mounts and gliders (`[mounts]`)

Bots use the mount and glider they own the way a player does on a long trip: they summon the
rideable mate of a `SummonMate` item, board it, ride at mount speed and get off again for a
fight, a quest talk, a harvest or a dungeon door. They also wear a glider on their back and fly
down a cliff that lies on their way instead of walking around it.

**The mount.** The summon is the item's use skill (`item_summon_mates` names the mate's NPC
template; the skill carries the `SpawnPet` effect), then `CSMountMatePacket` (0x0a7) takes the
driver seat; the server answers `SCUnitAttached` and the mate's unit state (with its timeline id
and object id). While riding, the bot sends its movement updates **for the mate** — a riding
player's own `CSMoveUnit` is ignored by the server (`world/session.rs:1191`), so the client moves
the mount instead — and gets off with `CSUnMountMatePacket` (0x0a8) or dismisses it with
`CSRemoveMatePacket` (0x0a4). The mate is summoned only when the rest of the trip is at least
`summon_over_m` long and the bot is moving, not fighting, not on a boat, not in an instance and
not travelling by portal; it leaves the seat when the trip is down to `dismount_under_m`, when a
fight starts or a blocking situation appears, and the standing mate is dismissed after
`idle_despawn_secs`. A mate that stands too far away to board (the server allows 6 m) is dismissed
and summoned again on the next long trip.

Every request has a deadline: a summon without `SCMateSpawned`, a mount without
`SCUnitAttached`, a refused skill (`SCSkillStarted.result != 0`) or an `SCErrorMsg` during the
request backs every mount attempt off for two minutes; no item without GM rights backs it off for
half an hour. A bot never loops on a refusal.

**The glider.** A glider is a back-slot item (`item_backpacks.backpack_type_id = 2`) whose use
skill the client starts with the item as caster; the server checks the back slot and the item's
own skill (`systems/skills/glider.rs`). The bot puts the best glider it owns in the back slot
(with `CSSwapItems`) while it is not fighting, and leaves a carried trade pack alone (the server
refuses a glider swap while a pack is worn). While it walks with at least 20 m left it samples
the ground up to `glide_lookahead_m` ahead: when the way falls away by at least `glide_drop_m` in one abrupt step
(a cliff, not a slope), the line before the edge has no wall and the landing is dry, and the edge is
within 6 m ahead (a cliff further off waits until the walk has brought it that close), it deploys
the glider, runs the last steps along the ground until the ground falls away from under it, and
then flies down along the current heading at `glide_speed` while descending
`glide_descent`. The flight is the bot's own client-side physics (the 1.2 client's glider is not
on the wire); it lands when the terrain meets it or the flight is 30 seconds old, sends the glide
stance (4) in its movement updates and plans its navmesh route again from where it landed.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch of mounts and gliders. |
| `mounts` | `true` | Bots summon and ride mounts. |
| `gliders` | `true` | Bots equip a glider and glide down a ledge. |
| `summon_over_m` | `250.0` | The shortest trip a mount is summoned for, metres. |
| `dismount_under_m` | `40.0` | A mounted bot dismounts when the rest of the trip is this short. |
| `speed` | `10.0` | Mounted run and walk speed, m/s. |
| `item` | `0` | The mount summon item; `0` = the lowest-id rideable mount of the bot's level (4177, the Lilyut horse). |
| `glider_item` | `0` | The glider item; `0` = the lowest-id glider of the bot's level (16385, Tooloop's old glider). |
| `idle_despawn_secs` | `120` | Dismiss a standing mate after this long without a trip (0 = keep it). |
| `glide_drop_m` | `8.0` | The smallest fall that is worth gliding, metres. |
| `glide_lookahead_m` | `30.0` | How far ahead the ground is sampled for a ledge, metres (4 to 200; a glide starts only when the edge is within 6 m). |
| `glide_speed` | `9.0` | Glide horizontal speed, m/s. |
| `glide_descent` | `3.0` | Glide descent, m/s. |

With `bots.gm_bootstrap` a bot grants itself the lowest-id rideable mount / glider of its level
when its bag holds none (`/item add self <template> 1`). Without it, a bot only uses what it
already carries; a mount it never gets is not retried for half an hour.

**Limits.** The summon item and the glider are real items from the server data; a server whose
data has no `item_summon_mates` / glider rows gets no mounts or gliders. There is no capture of
the 1.2 client's exact mount speed or glider physics in this project, so `speed`, `glide_speed`
and `glide_descent` are operator settings (the defaults are a horse's pace and a conservative
glide), and the server does not validate either on a GM account. A bot does not use a carriage,
an airship or a player's mount as a passenger.

## Farming (`[farm]`)

With `[farm] enabled` bots plant crops, wait for them and harvest them, and they grow what the server
is short of. The web UI shows the bots in the goal as `farm`, and the bot's detail view lists its
plots (the crop, where, ripe or growing, honest or not). Everything below is off until `enabled`;
the keys are in [Switched-off features](#switched-off-features).

**One run.** The goal does one of two jobs per run.

* *Harvest*, when a plot is due (ripe, or its growth time is over): walk to the crop, cast the
  harvest skill (the labor-cost variants of the crop's `harvest` skill), wait for the crop to change
  and, with `replant`, plant the seeds the harvest gave back on the same spot.
* *Plant*, otherwise, while the bot has room for plots: choose a crop, buy its seeds from the nearest
  seed vendor within `max_trip_m`, walk to a free spot, plant up to five seeds and go back to other
  goals. A run ends after 25 minutes at the latest; a bot plants again five minutes after the end of a
  run.

**Which crop.** Every crop of the game data that grows on dry land is scored by profit per hour, time
to ripen, distance to the seed vendor and what the bot already holds. On top of that comes the need:
an item on the wish list (the Economy view, `auto_boost`, or the API) counts 3, an item that is scarce
counts twice its scarcity, both damped by how much of the item the other bots already grow (the
hub's farm board, halved at 40 units). A wished item beats any profit, so "boost Potato" shifts bots
to potatoes, and thirty bots do not all plant the one scarce item.

**Where.** The server lets a character plant anywhere on dry ground within 30 m, but a plot costs
labor everywhere except in two places, which are the only ones the bots use (unless `wild`, below):

* the **garden of the bot's own house** (`own_land`), a square of twice the garden radius around it;
* a **public farm** (`public_farms`), the farm sub zones. A character may have 10 crops on a field
  farm and 5 on the other kinds (nursery, ranch, stable); `max_plots` caps the bot below that, and
  the server's answer "farm is full" ends the run (the goal then rests for a minute). The farms come from `farm_areas.json`, baked from the
  client pak by `playerbots bake` (a data directory baked before the farming feature needs a new bake, or
  `cargo run -p aa-bake --release --example bake -- --only farms ...`; see
  [DATA-FORMATS.md](DATA-FORMATS.md#farm_areasjson--public-farm-polygons));
  without the file only gardens are used.

A spot is drawn from the free ground of the place, at least 1.6 m from any other crop and 1.5 m from
the edge of a farm. A spot the server refused (water, too close to a doodad or a unit, a restricted
zone) is not tried again for ten minutes, a seed it refused to plant is left alone for thirty. Bots
that pick a spot claim it with the other bots (`Contest` plot cells of 3 m), so two bots do not plant
on the same square.

**Growth time.** The ripe time is not on the wire. The bot plans with the crop's growth time from the
data divided by `growth_rate`: set it to the server's `World.GrowthRate`. A plot is due when the
server announced that the crop is ripe (a phase change) or the planned time is over; a bot that comes
back to a crop that is still growing looks again five minutes later, so a wrong rate only costs
visits, not crops.

**Honest produce.** A harvest is something the bot may sell only when the seeds were bought. With
`bots.gm_bootstrap`, a bot without a vendor or money may mint seeds with a GM command; the seeds are
not clean, so the crop it gives is not either. The ledger opens a harvest window for the length of
the harvest cast: a plot planted from clean seeds is `honest` and its produce counts as the bot's
own (and may be sold, see [Selling](#selling-market)); a plot from minted seeds, or one found again
after a reconnect, is not counted at all. The plot list in the web UI shows which is which.

**Wild farms.** With `wild`, a bot whose `outlaw` trait is at least `wild_outlaw` (or a farm goal
given the `wild` argument) also plants up to `wild_plots` crops on one small patch out in the open:
a secluded spot 60 to 600 m away on dry, flat ground, outside the public farms, the housing areas
and zones at war, away from townsfolk, quest givers, recall and respawn points, aggressive monsters
and real players. Each seed there costs the labor of its use skill (10 points for most seeds), so a
bot plants only as many as its labor pays for (a GM bot tops its labor up). The plots are kept in
the bot's journal, so it comes back for them after a restart. Anybody may harvest a crop out in the
open: when the bot comes back and its crop is gone, the log says so, the journal counts it as
stolen, and the next patch goes somewhere else. The server lets a stranger who harvests a crop
within 24 hours of the planting leave footprints (a crime the owner can report). The web UI shows
such plots with the land "wild".

**Stealing.** With `steal`, those outlaws also harvest a ripe crop out in the wild that is not
theirs when no real player is near: only the crops of the other bots of this process, unless
`steal_from_players` (never with `bots.gm_bootstrap`). What a theft gives never counts as the bot's
own (it is not sold), and the stolen spot is not planted again. Together with wild farms this makes
the bots rob each other now and then, and the robbed ones move their patch.

**Limits and memory.** A bot remembers at most 64 plots. The memory sits behind one pointer in the
bot's market state, so a bot that never farms pays eight bytes. The farming bots publish what they are
growing to the hub's board (at most 16 items each, dropped when the bot leaves) and the Economy
view's "Growing" column is its sum.

## Presence (`[presence]`)

With `[presence] enabled` the bots log in and out on schedules of their own, so the population rises
in the evening and thins out at night like a real server's. Off by default: every bot started stays
online.

* **Rhythm.** Every bot has a chronotype (early bird, daytime, evening, night owl) and a dedication
  in its personality (`[personality]`; without it every bot is a daytime player of middling
  dedication). A casual bot plays one session of 20 to 60 minutes on most days; a dedicated one
  plays for hours, sometimes twice a day, with breaks, and skips fewer days; weekends run longer.
  The schedule follows from the bot id and the day, so it is the same after a restart. The clock is
  the machine's local time, or UTC plus `utc_offset_hours`.
* **Passes.** Every 20 seconds presence compares who is online with who is scheduled. It logs in
  scheduled bots through the usual login ramp (at most `max_starts_per_min`) and logs out its own
  bots whose session is over (at most `max_stops_per_min`). It never logs out a bot that is trading,
  duelling, in a dungeon, at a market meeting, on a boat or in the party of a real player; that bot
  goes at a later pass.
* **Bounds.** `min_online` keeps that many bots online at all hours (presence logs in unscheduled
  ones, the next to play first); `max_online` caps the bots online (0: no cap, only the roster).
  Both count every online bot.
* **Who decides.** The population director's bots are its own: presence leaves them alone but
  counts them. A bot you start in the web UI is never logged out by presence; a bot you stop is not
  logged in again until its current session would have ended. With presence on, nobody is started
  at launch: `bots.count` only sizes the roster (new characters are made as usual when a bot first
  logs in).
* **Goodbyes.** With `[social]` on, a bot whose session ends may say a short goodbye in local chat
  first (`goodbye_chance`) and leaves twenty seconds later.
* **Web UI.** The Director view has a "Presence" block: local time, online and scheduled, the target
  and bounds, log-ins and log-outs in the last hour, the next changes, the bots per chronotype and a
  bar chart of the day. The bot's journal counts its sessions and play time.

## Exploring (`[explore]`)

Bots now and then go and see a place (goal `explore`, on by default): a zone they have never been
to, the high ground of a zone, the coast, a recall point or the middle of a zone, within
`max_trip_m` (6 km). They pick places safe for their level (no aggressive monsters `level_gap`
levels above them at the place, none much stronger on the way, nothing the quest goal calls
deadly), out of zones at war and reachable on foot or by portal; they look around for a minute or
two and jump for joy at a new zone or on a hill. A place they could not reach is left alone for six
hours. How often depends on the `explorer` trait of the personality: a born explorer goes every 20
minutes or so (`trip_gap_mins` 45 times `1.5 - explorer`), a bot that does not care rarely. The
bot's journal remembers the zones it stood in (whatever it was doing), the places it saw and its
trips. `[explore] enabled = false` switches the goal off.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | The goal is on. |
| `max_trip_m` | `6000.0` | The farthest place a bot goes to on its own (metres, straight; 100 to 100000). A zone given with the goal's `zone` argument may be farther. |
| `level_gap` | `5` | Hostile aggressive monsters this many levels above the bot make a place unsafe (1 to 60). |
| `trip_gap_mins` | `45` | Minutes between two trips of an average bot (0 to 1440). |

## Gear (`[gear]`)

On by default. Bots put on the best gear they have for their level, get better pieces as they level,
socket lunagems and, if you let them, regrade. The web UI shows a bot in the goal as `gear`; its
detail view lists what it wears (slot, item, item level, grade, gems), its tier and what it did this
session.

**The equip duty** runs whatever the bot does, every `check_secs` (20 s): it puts on the best piece
of the bag that is worth at least 3 % more than the worn one. The worth is the item level, the grade
(like the game's stat multiplier), the gems and how well the piece suits the class build (its armor
kind and weapon kinds; a plate build wears cloth only when it has nothing better, a staff build
never holds a sword). A piece above the bot's level requirement is never put on (the server does not
check it). The duty waits in a fight, a trade, an instance and while the bot travels by portal; a
piece the server refuses is left alone for ten minutes.

**The goal** tiers up: bands of ten levels, each with a lowest item level (7 for levels 10 to 19, 17
for 20 to 29, ...) and a grade (common up to level 19, then uncommon, rare, ancient, heroic). One run
does one job, in this order:

* `buy` a better piece from a merchant within `max_trip_m` that costs at most `max_spend_pct` of the
  bot's money (the merchants sell starter sets up to level 14; while minting is allowed a bot only
  buys what meets its tier);
* `mint` the best piece of its tier for an empty or weak slot (`bots.gm_bootstrap` and `mint`): at
  most the bot's level, at the tier's grade, armor of the build's kind, the build's weapons; never a
  quest, test or NPC item, at most 24 pieces a session;
* `socket` a lunagem into a free socket (the grade sets how many: none below uncommon): the first gem
  always (the server's chance is 100 %), a second one only for a bot with a high `gearhead`
  (the chance is 50 %, and a failure takes every gem of the piece out). The gem comes from the bag
  or is minted;
* `regrade` a worn piece below the tier's grade with a regrade scroll (`regrade` and
  `bots.gm_bootstrap`), only at grades where a failure cannot destroy the piece; a failure that can
  lower the grade only for a bot with a high `gearhead`. Off by default.

The agent API and the LLM director can start the goal with an item (the `act` command with
`"goal": "gear"` and `"item": <template>`): the
bot gets that piece (bag, merchant or GM) and puts it on even when it is worse, or sockets that gem.
A finished quest that lets the player choose a reward gets the reward that suits the bot best.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch: the equip duty, the goal, the quest reward pick. |
| `buy` | `true` | Buy better pieces from merchants (copper only). |
| `mint` | `true` | Mint pieces and gems of the tier with GM commands (needs `bots.gm_bootstrap`). |
| `socket` | `true` | Socket lunagems. |
| `regrade` | `false` | Regrade worn pieces (needs `bots.gm_bootstrap`). |
| `max_spend_pct` | `30` | The most a purchase may cost, in percent of the bot's money (1 to 100). |
| `check_secs` | `20` | Seconds between two looks of the equip duty (1 to 3600). |
| `max_trip_m` | `3000.0` | The farthest a bot goes to a merchant, in metres. |

**Memory.** A bot keeps what it knows of its gear behind one pointer: at most 48 facts (bag grades,
gems), eight refusals, sixteen fetched templates. The journal's `gear` section keeps the last change,
the copper spent, what was minted and the last eight failed socketings across restarts.

## Selling (`[market]`)

The market features let bots sell what they gather: the goal `auction` lists goods at the auction
house, and the trade-chat market advertises them, answers buyers and meets them (the goal `market`
does the meeting). `[market]` is their configuration:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch: `false` and no bot lists, advertises or sells anything. |
| `auction` | `true` | Bots list surplus goods at the auction house. |
| `chat_ads` | `true` | Bots advertise surplus goods in trade chat. |
| `sell_to_players` | `false` | Bots sell to real players in a trade; never while `bots.gm_bootstrap` is on. |
| `meet_at` | `"auto"` | Where a buyer is met: `"auto"` (Mirage Isle when the bot can get there, else the town), `"mirage"` or `"town"`. |
| `max_ads_per_hour` | `12` | All bots together post at most this many advertisements per hour (0 = none). |
| `ad_interval_secs` | `900` | One bot posts one at most this often (at least 60). |

**What a bot may sell.** Never "what is in the bag" but what it came by honestly. Every item change
the server sends names its reason (`ItemTaskType`); the bot's provenance ledger
(`bot/market/ledger.rs`) counts a gain only for loot (9, 10, 35), a picked-up craft product (29),
quest rewards and supplies (37, 38), gathering skill effects (42, 43) and vendor purchases (54).
GM-made goods (11), trades, mail and auction returns never count. Whatever leaves the bag, for any
reason, is taken off the ledger first, so the ledger errs on the side of selling less; it holds at
most 64 item kinds per bot and is forgotten when the connection is lost. Of what is left, only
items that are tradable (`ItemFacts::tradable`) are offered, and the bot keeps back a part of them.

* **Tradable** means sellable (a vendor takes it), unbound (`bind_id` 1) and not a quest item. A
  quest item is one in the quest item category, one that only drops during a quest, or one that a
  quest tells the bot to take (an item that starts a quest, a quest step's obtained or supplied
  items; the reward step's items are ordinary). The materials a quest merely asks the bot to
  gather or use (hay bales, seeds) are not quest items. An item the table does not know is not
  tradable. The same test decides everything below: a bot never sells, asks for, buys or hands
  over an item that is not tradable.
* **Kept back** per item kind is the larger of two numbers: a reserve of 10 of items the bot may
  use itself (anything that casts a skill when used, anything a quest asks to gather), and what the
  bot's active quests still ask of it (the gather and use counts of their objectives, summed).
  An item a quest needs in full is never offered, listed, or put up in a trade, and a deal agreed
  in chat is dropped when a quest taken in the meantime needs the goods.

### Auction house

With `[market] enabled` and `auction` a bot visits an auctioneer at most about every 45 minutes,
when it has goods worth the trip (or gold to spend) and the auctioneer is within 3.5 km on the
walkable mesh. The nearest reachable auctioneer comes from the world data's NPC spawns. A visit is
a state machine that lasts a few minutes:

1. **Walk** to the auctioneer and wait until it is in view (an auctioneer that is not at its spawn
   is filed as an issue). An auctioneer the bot cannot reach, or died on the way to, is left alone
   for half an hour.
2. **Survey** the first pages of the house and the character's own lots.
3. **Price and post.** For each honest surplus stack (see [Selling](#selling-market)) the bot looks
   at the five cheapest buyouts of the item, takes their median per item as the going rate and asks
   95 to 99 % of it; with no market it asks between the vendor price and the item's base price. The
   fee (1 % of the buyout for 6 hours up to 4 % for the 48 hours the bot chooses, paid in cash) is
   not refunded and the seller gets 90 % of the price by mail, so a stack is listed only when that
   net beats the vendor refund by 8 %. Up to four whole stacks are listed per visit (the bot cannot
   split stacks), a bot that cannot pay the expected fees does not go, and the start price is 90 %
   of the buyout.
4. **Cancel and relist.** Now and then (35 %) a lot older than 90 minutes that has been undercut
   by more than 20 % is looked at again and cancelled; the item comes back by mail and is priced
   again.
5. **Browse and buy.** Only when `bots.gm_bootstrap` is off: with gold above 2,000 copper the bot
   looks at the cheapest lots (the first pages) and buys out up to two of them: a lot that costs at
   most 75 % of what a vendor would pay for it, or a consumable the bot can use itself (it casts a
   skill and the item's level fits) that costs no more than a shop asks. A lot of an item that is
   not tradable (a quest item, a bound or an unsellable one) is never bought, however cheap: no
   vendor would take it back. It spends at most a quarter of its money (50,000 copper at most) per
   visit.
6. **Linger** a few seconds, then leave.

The results arrive as mail (types 13 cancelled lot, 14 sale, 15 expired lot or outbid refund, 16
won lot). A background duty lists the mailbox every five minutes and after a post, reads each new
auction mail and takes its money or item; mails stay in the box after taking, so the bot remembers
the ones it settled. Memory is bounded per bot (24 price notes, 16 own lots, 8 skips, 4 pending wins).

Reported as issues: a post that took the item and fee without `SCAuctionPosted`, a confirmed lot
missing from the own lots, a search that gets no answer next to the auctioneer, a buyout that took
the money without `SCAuctionBid` or never delivered the item, an own lot that vanished with no
result mail, an auction mail that is empty or cannot be read, and any error code that the rules do
not explain (241 cannot pay and 388 too far are handled). The log line at the end of a visit
totals the bot's visits, lots posted, fees, sales, purchases and timeouts.

### Selling in trade chat

The chat market is a duty every bot runs next to its goal, plus the goal `market` for the meeting.

* **Ads.** A bot with clean surplus posts a `WTS` line in the trade channel; one that needs goods
  posts a `WTB` line (only for tradable goods). Item names that a line is read against are those
  of tradable items, so a request for a quest or bound item finds no match and gets no answer.
  Wording varies, prices come from the vendor values of the item (a little
  over half way between what a vendor pays and asks), lines are plain text of at most 200
  characters with no item links. A bot posts only when somebody could read it (other bots or a
  player in the same zone group's trade chat), at most every `ad_interval_secs` (with jitter),
  and all bots together at most `max_ads_per_hour` ads and 14 market lines per minute.
* **Talk.** A small grammar reads "how much", "price", "i'll take", "x20", "30s", "1g", "deal",
  "ok", "no", "too much", "meet", "where". The seller quotes, counters once and never goes under
  its floor; the buyer haggles once and never pays over its ceiling. Replies go out the way the
  other side spoke (whisper for whisper, the trade channel addressed by name for channel lines),
  which also serves characters of the other faction, who cannot be whispered (error 437). Bots
  buy from and sell to each other's ads. Nothing a bot says gives away that it is a bot.
* **Meeting.** `meet_at = "auto"`: the same faction near the same town meets at that town's
  auctioneer; another faction, far apart, or a buyer nobody can place meets on Mirage Isle. The
  bot walks to the nearest portal doodad (template 4894, next to the auctioneers), casts it, waits
  at the mailbox, trades, and leaves through the exit doodad (4895). It waits four minutes for
  the buyer and drops a deal after twelve.
* **Safe trades.** Every trade made from chat has a deal: who, what the bot gives, what it must
  receive. The partner must be the agreed character; money must be at least the price and the
  goods exactly the agreed ones; the bot's own offer must be unchanged. The server unlocks both
  sides on any change, so the bot checks again after every unlock before it locks, and cancels on
  a mismatch (one copper for the goods, a swapped item, an offer changed after the lock, the wrong
  character) or on a timeout. Requests from anybody else during a meeting are declined.
* **Economy safety.** Only the clean ledger is sold, never GM-made goods, trade, mail or auction
  returns, and only tradable items beyond what the bot's quests need. Real players are served only with `sell_to_players = true`, never while
  `bots.gm_bootstrap` is on. Everything is off with `enabled = false` or `chat_ads = false`.
* **Issue detectors** (see Server issue reports): a portal doodad that is not in view 20 s after
  the bot reached its spawn point (the data places it, the server does not show it), a portal
  cast the server accepted that never loaded the island within 30 s, an exit cast that leaves the
  bot on the island, a trade both
  sides confirmed that moved nothing, and refused whispers (error 437 or 265, reported only as
  information, the bot being the suspect).

Force the goal from the web UI to make a bot post an ad at once and listen for buyers for four
minutes. The stand-in "need" of a WTB bot is one of the shared trade goods it holds hardly any of.

## Chat and the LLM

### Chat without the LLM

Social chat is on by default (`[social]`) and needs no LLM:

* A whisper to a bot is answered with a whisper; a local line that names the bot, or that a real
  player (a character that is not one of the roster) says within `social.reply_radius_m` (30 m),
  is answered in local chat. Of all the bots that overhear an unaddressed line only one answers.
* The reply is a short line from a small table, flavoured by the bot's temperament and chosen so
  that it does not repeat itself, after a human-like pause.
* Bots also chat with each other, rarely: "gg" after a duel, a thanks after a trade, now and then
  a hello to a bot standing close by. By default only while a real player is within 150 m.
* They remark on what happens to them, say things unasked near a real player and, the chattier
  ones, now and then on the shout, trade or group-finding channel: see
  [Personalities](#personalities).
* Everything is rate limited per bot (a pause between replies, a burst cap, a cap per
  conversation, a cap on unasked lines) and for all bots together (`social.replies_per_min`,
  `social.chatter_per_min`, `personality.ambient_per_min`, `personality.channel_lines_per_hour`).
  `social.bot_chatter = false` silences every unasked line; `social.enabled = false` all chat.
* System and notice lines the server sends (for example the answer to a GM command) are not
  dropped: they are kept in a small ring per bot that goals read.

### Personalities

Every bot has a personality in the roster (`chatty`, `joker`, `crude` and the traits of the other
features; the web UI shows it in the bot's detail and the `profile` command changes it). In chat:

* **Chattiness.** A chatterbox answers more of what it overhears (up to 1.75 times
  `social.reply_chance`), waits less between lines, remarks on more of what happens and says an
  ambient line every few minutes; a quiet bot answers a third as often and hardly says anything
  unasked. Each bot says at most 1 (quiet) to 5 (chatterbox) unasked lines in 10 minutes, with a
  gap of 30 s (chatterbox) to 2 minutes (quiet) between two.
* **Remarks.** "ding" at a level up, "rip" after a death, a sigh about gankers after a death to a
  character, a word after a quest, a sold trade pack, a harvest, a finished house, a bag full of
  loot, a duel won or lost, a trade. Nothing is said while dead; the remark about a death comes
  after the resurrection.
* **Ambient lines.** While a real player is near, small talk and jokes in local chat. All bots
  together say at most `personality.ambient_per_min` (2) a minute. A jokey bot tells ArcheAge jokes
  (labor that always runs out, gankers on the trade routes, Freedich and the Kraken, the login
  queue, regrades that break weapons, lunagems, stolen crops and thunderstruck trees, Mirage Isle,
  Diamond Shores, pirates, Hasla, carrot farmers, the land rush, lag), and no bot tells a joke
  another bot told lately.
* **Channels.** The chattier bots (chattiness 0.3 and up) now and then say a line on shout, trade
  or group finding; all bots together at most `personality.channel_lines_per_hour` (4) an hour.
  These lines are banter, never advertisements or requests the bot would not follow up.
* **Profanity.** A crude bot swears now and then, only as an exclamation about the game, never at
  a player. `personality.profanity` caps every line, canned or written by the LLM: `off` (none),
  `mild` (damn, hell, crap, wtf, ffs; the default) or `strong` (harsher words too). A word above
  the cap is softened ("damn" becomes "dang", "fuck" becomes "frick") or the line is not sent.
  Slurs, hate, sexual words, insults and threats are refused at every level, for the lines of
  every feature (also behind leetspeak or stretched letters).
* **With the LLM** (`[llm] enabled`): the model gets the bot's style (quiet or chatty, dry or
  jokey, how coarse it may be) in its prompt, and with `personality.llm_chatter` (on by default)
  it writes about half of the ambient lines, at most 2 a minute for all bots together, inside the
  LLM's own budget; the canned line is the fallback.
* `personality.enabled = false`: every bot talks like the neutral profile and stays clean.

The worked-out numbers in two simulated hours next to a real player: a chatterbox says about 45
unasked lines, a neutral bot about 11, a typical bot about 5, a quiet one about 2. However many
bots there are, the process says at most `chatter_per_min + ambient_per_min` (6) unasked lines a
minute plus `channel_lines_per_hour` (4) an hour.

### Chat and decisions with an LLM (optional)

Any OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` endpoint works. DeepSeek is the default:

```toml
[llm]
enabled = true
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com"
model = "deepseek-chat"
api_key_env = "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"      # the NAME of the environment variable; the key is never in the file
max_requests_per_minute = 30
daily_token_budget = 200000           # prompt + completion tokens per UTC day, all bots together
director = true                       # optional, see below
director_interval_secs = 600
director_plan_steps = 3               # steps the model may plan ahead
director_triggers = true              # ask sooner after a level-up, a death, a failure, a new zone
director_min_gap_secs = 120           # never two requests of one bot closer than this
director_notes = true                 # let the answer carry a note for the bot's journal
```

```sh
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...        # PowerShell: $env:DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "sk-..."
playerbots run --config playerbots.toml
```

* **Replies.** The bot builds a persona from its roster entry (name, race, class, temperament,
  personality, the zone it is in) and asks the model for one short chat line in character, with the last four lines
  of its conversation with that player as context. The request runs on its own task; the bot never
  waits for the network. Whispers come back as whispers.
* **Director.** With `llm.director = true` each bot asks, about every `director_interval_secs`
  (jittered), what to do next, given a short summary of its level, health, zone, money,
  personality, recent goals, surroundings, how many zones it has seen and its last notes. It is
  offered at most ten numbered options: the goals it may pick right now (not switched off, not
  cooling down, no GM-only goal without `gm_bootstrap`), best first, and concrete variants it can do
  now:

  | Option | Offered when |
  | --- | --- |
  | `explore <zone>` | the explore goal is eligible and `[explore]` is on; up to two zones the bot has never been in (its journal), within 8 km, with quests at most five levels above it, reachable on the navigation mesh, not in a zone at war it keeps out of, and not deadly for its level (the quest goal's danger test: no aggressive monsters ten levels above it around the place, none fourteen levels above along the way) |
  | `wander to the town of <zone>` | the wander goal is eligible and the quest hub of its zone is 150 m to 3 km away |
  | `wander home` | the wander goal is eligible and its finished house is 150 m to 5 km away |
  | `farm wild` | the farm goal is eligible, `[farm] wild` is on and the bot's outlaw trait is 0.6 or more |

  The model answers with a short plan, up to `director_plan_steps` steps, an optional note and a
  reason, as JSON (`{"steps":[{"choice":2},{"choice":0}],"note":"...","reason":"..."}`). A step
  that names no offered option is dropped. The first step starts at once if the bot is idle,
  strolling or resting, otherwise when its goal ends; every later step starts when the goal before
  it ends, and each is checked again first (a goal that is no longer eligible, a zone it has seen
  meanwhile, a wild farm no longer allowed: dropped). A plan is forgotten after 30 minutes, when a
  newer one comes, and when the operator or an agent gives the bot a goal; it never overrides a
  goal the operator forced. If the request fails the bot's own scoring decides. The log shows
  `director: explore Gweonid Forest, then grind (new sights)` and `goal: explore (director 1/2)`.
* **When the director asks.** By the interval, and with `director_triggers` sooner after a
  level-up, a death, a failed goal, entering a zone the bot has never been in (not while it
  explores on purpose) or when its plan runs out; the situation then says why. Never two requests
  of one bot within `director_min_gap_secs` (and not in its first minute), one in flight at most,
  and the global limits below apply to all of them. While a plan is waiting the interval alone does
  not ask.
* **Notes.** With `director_notes` the answer may carry one short line the bot wants to remember
  ("the docks are busy at night"). It is filtered like a chat reply (no command, no link, no "I am
  an AI", at most 120 characters) and kept in the journal (`notes`, at most 16 per bot, the oldest
  go first). The next questions show the last three notes as quoted JSON strings marked as data,
  not instructions; the web UI's bot detail shows them, and so does the agent API.
* **Costs are bounded.** All bots share `max_requests_per_minute`, `max_concurrent` and
  `daily_token_budget`; a request over a limit is refused locally and costs nothing, and the bots
  fall back to canned lines and their own scoring. A reply is capped at `max_reply_tokens`. The web
  UI shows requests, failures, throttled requests, tokens used today and left, chat replies,
  director picks (steps started), plans and notes. A chat request is a persona prompt of a few hundred tokens plus the last lines of
  the conversation, and its reply is capped at `max_reply_tokens`; watch the numbers for a while
  and set the budget to taste.
* **Safety.** Model output is untrusted. Every reply goes through `pb_llm::sanitize_reply`, which
  rejects (rather than repairs) anything that starts with `/` or a look-alike of it (the server
  would run it as a GM command), contains a link or an address, a slur, hate, a sexual word, an
  insult or a threat, or gives away that the speaker is an AI, and cuts the rest to 120
  characters; then the bot's profanity level caps the swearing (see
  [Personalities](#personalities)). The send path checks again and refuses any chat line
  whose first visible character is a slash, empty or too long. Other players' words only ever
  appear as chat messages, never in the instructions, and names are reduced to letters and digits
  before they reach a prompt. The director's options are made by the bot from its own eligibility
  and its answer can only name one of them (by number); its notes are filtered like a reply and
  shown back only as quoted data. GM commands never come from model output. If the key is missing
  the add-on is simply off.

### Agent API and MCP

An LLM agent outside the process (or any program) can read and steer the bots through the web API,
with the same checks and the same token as the operator's web UI (`[web] token` for every `POST`, the
loopback `Host` check for every route).

```text
GET  /api/agent/tools          every action an agent may take: name, description, JSON schema, route
GET  /api/agent/bots           one short row per bot (id, name, class, level, zone, goal, activity)
GET  /api/agent/observe/{id}   one bot in a few dozen lines
GET  /api/agent/zones          zone names and keys
POST /api/bots/{id}/command    the commands, as for the web UI
```

`observe` is made for a model's context window: name, race, class, level, health and mana, zone and
position, the running goal and what it is doing, the goals the bot may start right now
(`eligible`, refreshed every 15 s by the bot itself), the director's plan, what is around it (a fair
monster, characters, real players), its last eight log lines, its personality, its notes and how
many zones it has seen.

The commands an agent uses most:

```json
{"type": "act", "goal": "explore", "zone": "Gweonid", "why": "never been there"}
{"type": "act", "goal": "wander", "x": 11380.0, "y": 11900.0}
{"type": "act", "goal": "farm", "wild": true}
{"type": "goal", "goal": "quest"}
{"type": "note", "text": "Bob owes us a duel"}
{"type": "say", "text": "anyone up for the boss?"}
```

`act` starts a goal once with details and then the bot chooses by itself again (a forced goal comes
back after it); a zone is a name (any case, a unique start is enough: `Gweonid`) or a key from
`/api/agent/zones`, and an ambiguous or unknown name is refused in words. `wander` with a point walks
there (by portal or `/move` when those are on, like any long trip) and strolls around it. A goal that
cannot succeed just fails and the bot moves on, so pick from `eligible`. `note` keeps a line in the
bot's journal (filtered like a model's note) that the director shows the model as the bot's own
memory. `set_goal`/`goal`, `say`, `whisper`, `profile`, `pause`, `resume`, `spawn` and `despawn` are
there too; `/api/agent/tools` lists them all with their arguments.

**MCP.** `playerbots mcp` speaks the Model Context Protocol on stdin and stdout and forwards each tool
call to the web API of a running `playerbots run`; its tools are the catalog above. The log goes to
stderr. The token is read from an environment variable whose name you give, so it never appears on a
command line or in a config file of the MCP client:

```sh
export PLAYERBOTS_WEB_TOKEN=...          # the same as [web] token
claude mcp add playerbots -- playerbots mcp --url http://127.0.0.1:8790 --token-env PLAYERBOTS_WEB_TOKEN
```

For Claude Desktop, the same in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{"mcpServers": {"playerbots": {"command": "playerbots",
  "args": ["mcp", "--url", "http://127.0.0.1:8790", "--token-env", "PLAYERBOTS_WEB_TOKEN"],
  "env": {"PLAYERBOTS_WEB_TOKEN": "..."}}}}
```

Without `--token-env` the reads work and the commands are refused when the web UI has a token. A
request takes at most 15 s, an answer at most 1 MiB is read and a message on stdin is at most
256 KiB. The bridge can do nothing the web UI could not: the web API checks every command (no line
starting with `/`, names and lengths, counts) before a bot sees it.

## Web UI

The map shows every bot by activity, with houses, duel flags and trade outlets; the list can be
searched; selecting a bot shows its state, quests, extra details, the last chat lines it heard or
said and its event log. Commands per bot: pause/resume, force a goal (quest, grind, duel, trade,
trade run, housing, dungeon, sail, auction, market, guild, gank, warzone, event, companion, farm,
rest, wander, or auto), duel or trade with another bot, say a line, whisper a
line to a character. Global: spawn/despawn bots, pause or resume all. With `[web] token` set, POST
requests need the header `x-playerbots-token`. While the UI is bound to a loopback address, every
route (reads included) refuses a request whose `Host` is not a loopback name (a DNS-rebinding page
in a browser can otherwise read the bots' state); a POST with the right token is exempt, as it
cannot come from such a page. Despawning a bot keeps its slot, account and character: spawning
again reuses the stopped bots first and creates a new roster entry only when none is free.

The World, Economy and Director views, the heat overlay and the director are described in
[World metrics and the population director](#world-metrics-and-the-population-director).

## World metrics and the population director

The side panel of the web UI has three views that look at the world instead of at single bots, and
a director that can log bots in and out because of what they show. The metrics are always on; only
the director is switched by `[population] enabled` (and it starts as a dry run).

### What the bots can see

A bot sees the characters within about 128 m. Every bot hands the characters in view that are not
one of ours to the **census**: character id, name, level, side, continent, zone and position. A
player counts for 60 seconds after the last bot saw it, and the census holds at most 2048 players.
So the census is a **lower bound** of the players online: a player in a corner of the map that no
bot passes is not in it. The World view shows the coverage when it can.

The side of a character is the mother faction of its faction (Nuia 148, Haranya 149); the continent
is the zone group of the zone it stands in (west, east, Auroria, sea). A bot's snapshot carries both
(`mother_faction`, `alliance`, `continent`, `zone_key`); before a bot is in the world, its side is
the side of its race.

### The views

* **World.** Tiles: players seen, bots online, players on the server, coverage, watched area. A
  table of continent by side (players seen / bots online), with a `+` in the home continent of each
  side (starts bots of that side) and a `-` wherever bots are (stops idle ones). A form to start or
  stop bots by side, race and continent. Busiest zones, the players in view (name, level, side,
  zone, age), what the online bots do (their goals) and what the game server says about itself.
  "Players on the server" and "unlocated" (players the server counts that no bot sees) need the
  server API, see below.
* **Heat** (checkbox above the map): 512 m squares with players (red) and bots (blue).
* **Economy.** The scarcest items first, with the scarcity bar, lots on the auction house, the
  market price against the vendor price, the price change over 30 minutes and the buy / sell lines
  in trade chat. `Grow` makes an item a *wish*; wishes are listed below the table with their time
  left. Hover a row for the reasons.
* **Director.** Mode (off, dry run, live, holding), the kill switch, the dry-run switch, the two
  sides (players, bots, the director's own bots, target), process health and its limits, the policy
  numbers, goal weights and the log of everything the director did or would do.

`#tab=world`, `#tab=economy` and `#tab=director` open a view from a link (`&heat=1` turns the heat on).
The raw data is `GET /api/world`, `GET /api/economy` and `GET /api/director`; the director's policy is
changed with `POST /api/director/policy` (a JSON object with the fields to change, e.g.
`{"dry_run":false}`), and `POST /api/command` takes `spawn_where` and `despawn_where`
(`{"type":"spawn_where","count":3,"filter":{"alliance":"nuia","race":"elf","continent":"west"}}`,
every filter key optional). These POSTs need the token like every other one.

**Filtered spawn and despawn.** A spawn picks free bots of the roster that match (the race decides
the side and the continent a bot starts on: Nuian and Elf are Nuia and start in the west, Hariharan
and Ferre are Haranya and start in the east) and grows the roster with matching races from
`bots.races` when there are too few. A despawn matches by where the bot is now (its side and the
continent it stands on) and picks the most harmless bots first: ones that stand, rest or wander,
then ones that walk to a quest or grind, last ones that carry a trade pack. It never stops a bot
that is fighting, dead, logging in, trading, dueling, in a dungeon, on a boat, at a market or
auction, in a guild or event task, a warzone or a gank (those goals finish first). Bots that never
logged in leave the start queue first.

### Economy and scarcity

The board follows up to 1500 items from three kinds of evidence, all bounded:

* the **price notes** of the bots (what they learned at the auction house: the market quote, how
  many lots they saw, five at most); every bot hands in its fresh notes every ten seconds, and the
  board keeps the latest note of six bots per item and a short price history;
* **trade chat**: a shout, trade or group-finding line that offers or asks for an item counts as a
  sell or a buy line for ten minutes. All bots near a speaker hear the same line, so it is counted
  once. A real player's line counts in full, a bot's a quarter (the bots' own advertisements must
  not drive the scarcity they would react to);
* the **server's auction list** (with `server_api` and its key): the exact number of lots and the
  median price per item; when it is fresh (ten minutes) it replaces the bots' guess at the supply.

The scarcity score runs from 0 (plenty) to 1 and adds four parts: few lots (`0.45 / (1 + lots / 2)`,
none for sale is the full 0.45), a price far above the vendor price (up to 0.25 at four times), a
rising price (up to 0.15 at +50 % in half an hour) and more people asking than offering in chat (up to
0.15). The farming goal reads it through `population::economy::ScarcityView` (`scarcity`,
`most_scarce`, `wished`), which `hub.pop` implements. The "Growing" column of the Economy table is
what the farming bots have planted and not yet harvested, per item (the expected count; zero when
no bot farms); an item that is being grown gets a row even when no bot noted a price for it.

### The director

Once a second the director looks at the players per side (the census) and the bots per side and
decides, by the rule **mirror**, how many bots each side should have:

```
target[side] = min(per_side_cap, max(min_per_side, ceil(mirror_pct / 100 * players[other side]) - players[side]))
```

When the east is heavy with players, the west gets bots until it has as many characters (players
plus bots) as the east, within the caps. A side that is short gets bots, up to `step` per action,
the shortest side first, and never above `max_online` bots in all. A side that has more than
`hysteresis` bots above its target loses the whole surplus, `step` per action, but **only bots the
director started itself** that have been up for 3 minutes and are safe to stop (see above): bots you
started by hand or at start-up are never touched. The dead band keeps a player at the edge of a
bot's view from making bots come and go.

**Safety.**

* It is **off** by default (`enabled = false`), and with `dry_run = true` (also the default) it only
  writes down what it would do, to the log of the Director view and the process log (`pb_pop`). The
  switches always start as `[population]` says, whatever the last run ended with (`policy_file` keeps
  only the numbers, wishes and goal weights).
* The kill switch of the Director view turns the whole director off at once; going live asks for
  confirmation. If the configuration has `enabled = false` it cannot be switched on from the UI.
* One action at a time, `min_action_gap_secs` apart, at most `max_spawn_per_min` bots a minute
  (both are hard limits from the configuration that the UI cannot lift), at most `step` bots per
  action, at most `max_online` bots and `per_side_cap` per side (every count is also bounded by the
  roster limit of 5000 bots).
* **Back-off**: while the bot process is over a limit it starts no bots (it may still stop some). The
  limits: memory, packets per second from the server, failed or short sessions in the last five
  minutes, open server issues. The reason is shown ("on hold: ...") and logged once.
* Every action, every refusal and every policy change is in the log with its reason. A dry run keeps
  the pace of a live run and does not repeat itself.

**Goal weights and wishes.** The Director view can scale the score of each goal for every bot
(0.1 to 3; blank is 1), applied while the director is live. Wishes (from the Economy view, or the
scarcest items when `auto_boost` is above 0) are recorded for the farming goal; while the director is
live and any wish exists, the `farm` goal is scored 1.5 times higher unless you set a weight for it.
That only matters with `[farm] enabled`, and the planner also reads the wishes itself when it picks
a crop (see [Farming](#farming-farm)).

**`[population]` keys.**

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `false` | Master switch of the director (the metrics are always on). |
| `dry_run` | `true` | The director only logs what it would do. |
| `max_spawn_per_min` | `10` | Hard limit: bots it starts per minute (0 = none). |
| `min_action_gap_secs` | `60` | Hard limit: seconds between two of its actions (at least 1). |
| `max_online` | `50` | Start values of the policy (editable live in the Director view): bots online in all. |
| `min_per_side` | `0` | Each side keeps at least this many bots. |
| `mirror_pct` | `100` | Characters per 100 players on the other side (0 to 1000). |
| `per_side_cap` | `20` | No side gets more bots than this from the director. |
| `step` | `3` | The most bots one action starts or stops (1 to 1000). |
| `hysteresis` | `2` | Bots above the target that a side keeps. |
| `despawn` | `true` | The director may stop the bots it started. |
| `backoff_rss_mb` | `3072` | Start no bots above this process memory (0 = ignore). |
| `backoff_packets_in` | `30000` | ... above this many packets per second (0 = ignore). |
| `backoff_login_failures` | `8` | ... after this many failed or short sessions in five minutes. |
| `backoff_open_issues` | `50` | ... with this many open server issues. |
| `policy_file` | unset | Keeps the numbers, wishes and goal weights between runs. |
| `server_api` | `""` | The game server's web API (`http://host:port`); empty = not used. |
| `server_api_key_env` | `""` | Name of the environment variable that holds the API's bearer key. |
| `server_api_key_file` | unset | A file whose first line is the key (used when the variable is unset). |
| `server_poll_secs` | `30` | Seconds between two polls (at least 5). |

The operator-only numbers `auto_boost` (automatic wishes, 0 to 16, default 0) and `auto_boost_min`
(scarcity from which an item becomes a wish, default 0.7) are set in the Director view.

### The server API (optional)

With `server_api` set, a background task polls the game server's own web API every
`server_poll_secs`: `GET /status` (public: uptime, players online, job counts), and with the key
`GET /api/world/logged-characters` (the exact list of online characters: the ones that are not our
bots are the real players, so the World view can say how many no bot sees) and, every fourth poll,
`GET /api/auction/list` (the exact lots, for the economy board). Without the key only `/status` is
used, and its `Players online` count (which includes every bot of every process) has our own bots
in the world taken off it ("approx." in the tile). The key comes from the environment variable named
in `server_api_key_env` or the first line of `server_api_key_file`; it is held in memory only, sent
only as the `Authorization` header and never logged, shown or written into an error text. The poll is
read-only and fails soft: an unreachable server is a line in the World view. Responses are cut at
16 MB, redirects are not followed and the request times out after 5 seconds.

## Memory and scale

One tokio task per bot, no per-bot reader task and no locks on the hot path. The per-bot structures
are small and bounded (the `per_bot_structures_stay_small` test prints them: the fixed part of a
bot is about 3 KB): at most 1024 units and 2048 useful doodads in view, an event
log of 32 lines, a chat ring of 8, at most four lines for each of three conversations. Chat and
director state is allocated at a bot's first tick (well under 1 KB). The terrain height grid is
memory-mapped and shared by all bots, so only the pages around the bots are resident. The web UI
shows the resident memory of the process and the bytes per online bot; the design target is under
256 KiB of bot-side state per bot. Ticks are adaptive with jitter (250 ms while moving or
fighting, longer when idle) so hundreds of bots do not wake up together. A walking bot that a real
player can see (within 190 m) also wakes between them, every `bots.move_update_ms` (125 ms), to move
on and send its position, as the client does about seven times a second; the server passes each
update to the players around, so the bots in view of players cost about twice the movement
traffic of before. Raise `move_update_ms` (up to `tick_ms`) to trade smoothness for traffic.

Measured numbers are in the [README](../README.md#memory-and-scale).
