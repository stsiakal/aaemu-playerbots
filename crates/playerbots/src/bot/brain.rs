//! The brain: chooses the next goal by utility scoring and runs it.
//!
//! Each goal gets a score: its configured weight, scaled by the bot's temperament (a quester likes
//! quests, a homebody likes housing and resting) and by the situation (rest when hurt, no grinding
//! when hurt or nothing to hit). The next goal is drawn at random in proportion to the scores, so
//! the bots do not all do the same thing at the same time. Goals that report
//! [`FailReason::NotImplemented`] are switched off for good, goals that fail otherwise rest for a
//! while ([`FAIL_COOLDOWN_MS`]).
//!
//! The dungeon, sail, auction, market, guild, gank, warzone, event, companion and farm goals are the
//! exception: the features that own them score them from the whole tick context (`own_scores`),
//! with none of the factors above (the guild, gank, warzone, companion and farm goals are stubs and
//! score 0 until their features exist). The event goal also has a duty hook: a running event it may
//! join pulls a bot out of the small goals at once ([`super::goals::event::duty`]), so a rift does
//! not wait for the end of a grind.
//!
//! Goals that cannot succeed for the bot right now (a trade run below the level of the lowest
//! pack recipe, housing without GM help or a design item) are left out of the draw up front
//! ([`gate`]); the answer is reused for [`GATE_TTL_MS`] and asked again after a level-up.
//!
//! The brain also calls the combat controller on every tick, so a bot defends itself whatever it is
//! doing, runs the chat duty ([`Social::tick`]) and, when `llm.director` is on, asks the LLM
//! director for a short plan now and then and after a level-up, a death, a failed goal or a new
//! zone ([`director`]): the model picks among the goals (and concrete variants of them) the
//! scoring itself would allow, the brain starts the plan's next step whenever a goal ends, and a
//! step that is no longer eligible is dropped silently. Every [`crate::agent::AGENT_EVERY_MS`] it
//! also tells the agent API which goals it may start ([`crate::agent::AgentSlot`]).
