//! The combat controller: engage a target, get into range, face it, cast the archetype's
//! rotation (or, without learned skills, its starter skill and the auto attack), and loot what
//! dies.
//!
//! The skill choice is the rotation engine's ([`super::rotation`]): once the bot knows skills,
//! [`Combat::tick`] asks the archetype's compiled rotation what to cast, falling back to the
//! starter skill and the basic attack when the rotation has nothing castable. The controller
//! also learns skills and unlocks abilities as the level grows ([`super::rotation::learn`]) and
//! keeps the bot engaged with its opponent during a duel ([`DuelWatch`]).
//!
//! The API is **stable on purpose** so the goals never had to change when the rotation arrived:
//!
//! * [`Combat::engage`] / [`Combat::disengage`] set or clear the target,
//! * [`Combat::tick`] runs one step and returns a [`CombatStatus`],
//! * [`Combat::on_event`] feeds it the server's answers (skill failures, loot windows),
//! * [`Combat::busy`] says whether a fight or a loot job is under way.
//!
//! Everything it decides is in small pure pieces ([`pick_skill`], [`Backoffs`], [`LootJob`],
//! [`arrival_radius`]) with their own tests; [`Combat::tick`] only gathers the facts from the
//! [`Ctx`] and acts on the verdict.
