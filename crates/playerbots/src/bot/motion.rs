//! The movement controller: walks a bot to a destination and tells the server about it.
//!
//! The server does not validate movement, so a bot is its own physics: [`Motion::tick`]
//! integrates the position along straight lines through the waypoints at run or walk speed, puts
//! the bot on the terrain ([`surface_z`]) and sends `CSMoveUnit` while moving plus one stopped
//! update on arrival. A stuck detector (less than [`STUCK_MIN_PROGRESS_M`] of progress in
//! [`STUCK_WINDOW_MS`]) inserts side steps and finally reports [`MoveFailure::Stuck`]; every trip
//! also has a [`TRIP_TIMEOUT_MS`] limit.
//!
//! While a real player can see the bot, the bot loop ticks the controller every
//! `bots.move_update_ms` (125 ms) and every tick of a walk sends an update, at an even pace like
//! the client's own; a bot nobody can see sends one a second. The server only knows the position
//! of the last `CSMoveUnit`, so it can see such a bot a run-second (5 m) behind. Before a packet
//! whose range the server checks (loot, talk, sell, craft, cast) the caller asks [`Motion::pin`]
//! for an exact update.
//!
//! A bot that has a [`NavLink`] ([`Motion::attach_nav`]) does not walk the straight line when the
//! navigation mesh knows the way: its [`NavState`] plans the trip and the controller integrates
//! the position along the route instead (see [`super::nav`]). The packets, the stopped update on
//! arrival, the stuck detector and [`Motion::pin`] work the same in both cases, and every
//! situation the mesh cannot help with (unreachable goal, planner late) is the straight line.
//!
//! Nothing here reads a clock or talks to a socket: the caller passes the bot clock and an
//! outbox ([`MotionEnv`]), which keeps the controller testable.
