//! The navigation state of one bot: plans a trip on the mesh and walks the route.
//!
//! [`NavState`] lives in the motion controller (`Motion::attach_nav`) and works on one trip at a
//! time. A trip starts with [`NavState::begin`] (the controller's `go_to`) and is driven by
//! [`NavState::step`] once per tick:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Unplanned ──► short trip: search on the bot task ──────────────┐
//!       │         long trip: request to the planner pool           ▼
//!       └──────► Planning (the bot stands, faces the goal) ──► Following ──► arrived
//!                    │ answer after >1.5 s, queue full,              │ route ends short of the goal
//!                    ▼ unreachable, off the mesh                     ▼
//!                  Legacy (the controller's straight line)      continuation (see below)
//! ```
//!
//! * **Continuations.** A partial answer (the search hit its cap) or a goal beyond
//!   [`MAX_PLAN_M`] is walked in pieces: the moment a route is installed that does not lead to the
//!   goal, the search for the next piece starts from the end of that route, so its answer is
//!   usually there before the bot is. At most [`MAX_CHAIN`] pieces per trip.
//! * **Stuck.** The controller's stuck detector asks [`NavState::on_stuck`]: the first
//!   [`MAX_STUCK_REPLANS`] times the route is searched again from where the bot is with the nodes
//!   on and just ahead of that spot made expensive; after that the trip is the controller's
//!   straight line with its side steps.
//! * **Answers are matched by ticket.** An answer for anything but the request the trip waits for
//!   is dropped (counted as stale).
//!
//! Nothing here reads a clock or talks to a socket except through the planner pool and the bot's
//! command channel; the caller passes the bot clock.
