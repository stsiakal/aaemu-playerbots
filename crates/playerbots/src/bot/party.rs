//! Parties: the coordinator's orders, what a bot knows of its team, and the planner that forms
//! parties for instance dungeons (owned by the dungeons feature).
//!
//! * A [`PartyOrder`] reaches each member as [`BotCmd::Party`](super::cmd::BotCmd::Party); the
//!   brain queues the goal the [`PartyPurpose`] names (today only
//!   [`GoalKind::Dungeon`](super::cmd::GoalKind)) and hands the order to it, where the goal reads
//!   it through [`Goal::with_party`](super::goals::Goal::with_party). Like a
//!   [`PairOrder`](super::cmd::PairOrder), an order is consumed by the goal it starts: a goal
//!   started any other way gets none.
//! * [`TeamLog`] follows the server's team packets (invitation, joined, member joined / left,
//!   left, dismissed, owner changed) and what the members target, for the dungeon goal and the
//!   combat controller's assist. It lives in [`PartyMem`] next to the dungeon memory (the last
//!   run, the entries the server counts, the dungeons the server refused), one box per bot that
//!   ever met a team.
//! * [`Wish`], [`Site`] and [`plan`] are the coordinator's side: the bots that want a dungeon,
//!   the dungeons it may send them to and the pure choice of who goes where.
//!
//! Everything here is plain data and pure functions; the `CSInviteToTeam` flow, who enters when
//! and what happens inside is the dungeon goal's business.
