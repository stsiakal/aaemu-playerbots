//! Dungeon: form a party with other bots and clear an instance dungeon (the dungeons feature).
//!
//! # The run
//!
//! A bot that picks the goal (by score, or because the operator asked) has no party yet: it
//! sends a [`Wish`](crate::bot::party::Wish) to the coordinator and waits ([`Phase::Gather`]).
//! The coordinator forms a party of bots that fit one dungeon and sends every member a
//! [`BotCmd::Party`](crate::bot::cmd::BotCmd::Party); the brain restarts the goal with that
//! [`PartyOrder`], and the run goes on:
//!
//! 1. **Prep / Team**: a level below the dungeon's range is raised with the GM `/level` (config
//!    `behavior.dungeon_level_up`, only with `bots.gm_bootstrap`); the leader invites the others
//!    one at a time, they accept the leader's invitation.
//! 2. **Travel / Muster**: walk (or `/move`) to the entrance doodad, wait until everybody is
//!    within 20 m, go in one after the other.
//! 3. **Enter / Load**: cast the entrance skill on the doodad; the server answers with
//!    `SCProcessingInstance` and `SCLoadInstance`, the bot answers `CSInstanceLoaded`.
//! 4. **Clear**: the leader walks the route (the hostile spawns of the world's data, grouped into
//!    stops, bosses last) and engages what it meets; the members follow within about 15 m and
//!    assist the leader's target (and the monsters that attack a member, see the combat
//!    controller). Everybody rests when low, the leader waits for stragglers and hurt members.
//! 5. **Leave / Out**: when the route is done, the time (25 min) is up, the party is gone, the
//!    bot died three times or the party was wiped twice, everybody walks to the nearest exit
//!    doodad and casts its skill; back in the main world the members leave the team and the
//!    leader dismisses it.
//!
//! Refusals of the entry are typed ([`entry`]) and answered by kind; a dungeon the server turned
//! away is left alone for a while (per zone group, see
//! [`PartyMem`](crate::bot::party::PartyMem)). With `[dungeons] entry_limit` on, three entries per
//! zone group and four hours are tracked like the server counts them; it is off by default
//! because the 1.2 server has no entry limit. What the server does that the data and the protocol
//! contradict is filed as an issue ([`report`]).
//!
//! The pieces: [`machine`] (the phases, pure), [`clear`] (the walk through the dungeon, pure),
//! [`route`] (the route, pure), [`entry`] (the refusals), [`report`] (the issues) and [`run`]
//! (the glue to the tick context). This file is the goal itself and its scoring.
