//! Trade run: craft a trade pack at a specialty workbench, carry it to a specialty NPC that buys
//! it, sell it and collect the payment mail.
//!
//! # The run
//!
//! ```text
//! Plan ─► Supply ─► ToBench ─► Craft ─► Crafting ─► ToBuyer ─► Sell ─► Selling ─► Payment ─► done
//!          (GM: /item add, /labor)        CSExecuteCraft                CSSellBackpackGoods
//! ```
//!
//! * **Plan** ([`plan`]): the bot picks a route once per run: a workbench spawn within reach that
//!   offers a pack craft, and the nearest spawn of an NPC buying the product, scored by the way
//!   there plus the carry (walking budgets [`WALK_BUDGETS_M`]; with `bots.gm_bootstrap` and
//!   `bots.long_travel_teleport_m` the budget is lifted because long trips become `/move`). A bot
//!   that already carries a pack skips the craft and goes to a buyer.
//! * **Supply**: crafting costs the recipe's materials and its labor, selling costs
//!   [`SELL_LABOR`] more. With `bots.gm_bootstrap` the bot gives itself exactly what is missing
//!   (`/item add self <item> <n>`, `/labor <n>`); without it only routes the bot can already pay
//!   for are planned.
//! * **ToBench / Craft / Crafting**: walk to the workbench, find its object in the entity view by
//!   template, stand within the craft skill's range and send `CSExecuteCraft`. The craft is done
//!   when the pack shows up in the equipment (the server equips it into the backpack slot); an
//!   `SCErrorMsg` 148 or silence ends the attempt, which is retried with backoff.
//! * **ToBuyer / Sell / Selling**: walk (the pack does not slow the bot down in the server's
//!   eyes; the bot just runs) to the NPC, stand within the server's 2.5 m, send
//!   `CSSellBackpackGoods`; the sale is confirmed by the pack leaving the equipment.
//! * **Payment**: the server pays by mail (instantly or after `TradePackMailDelayInMinutes`).
//!   Collecting it is a background duty that outlives the goal: [`collect_payments`] runs on every
//!   brain tick, reads and takes the payment mail whenever it shows up (see [`ledger`]).
//!
//! The state machine talks to the bot through the small [`Env`] trait so it can be tested with
//! synthetic server events; [`Live`] is the implementation around [`Ctx`].
