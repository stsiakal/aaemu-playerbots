//! What one bot knows: itself, the units and doodads the server shows it, its bag, quests,
//! cooldowns and buffs.
//!
//! [`BotState::apply`] is the only writer: every parsed [`ServerEvent`] updates the state, and
//! the few events that need an answer (a server teleport, a death, a kick) leave a note in
//! [`BotState::reactions`] for the bot task to act on. The state never touches the network and
//! never reads a clock (the bot task sets [`BotState::now_ms`] first), so it is deterministic and
//! testable.
//!
//! Memory is bounded: units are capped at [`MAX_UNITS`], doodads at [`MAX_DOODADS`] (and the
//! bot task drops doodads that do nothing before they get here), the small lists are
//! [`SmallVec`]s with hard limits, strings are kept only where something reads them (character
//! names).
