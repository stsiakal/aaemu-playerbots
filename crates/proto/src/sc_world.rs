// Ported from the S->C writers of AAEmu-1.2-Rust rust/crates/aaemu-game/src (cited per variant), GPL-3.0-or-later.
//! Server → client parsers for the world, units, the own character, inventory, combat, chat and
//! loot (see [`crate::sc`]).
//!
//! Every reader mirrors the server writer cited in its variant's doc comment (paths are relative to
//! `rust/crates/aaemu-game/src` of AAEmu-1.2-Rust, GPL-3.0-or-later like this crate). The
//! dispatcher matches on the opcode first, so a packet bots do not need costs one `match` and no
//! allocation; [`interesting`] answers the same question without a body.
//!
//! Conventions: object ids are the 24-bit `bc` ids of the wire; hit points and mana are returned
//! as real values (the wire carries them times 100); positions are world coordinates in metres.
//! Events own their strings as `Box<str>`/small vectors, and the large ones are boxed, so a
//! [`WorldEvent`] stays small.
